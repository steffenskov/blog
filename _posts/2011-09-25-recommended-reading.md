I often come across some good articles, so I decided to start sharing them.

Iâ€™ll start with one of the best articles Iâ€™ve read about ASP.Net Webforms development: [TRULY Understanding Viewstate](http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/03/Truly-Understanding-Viewstate.aspx "TRULY Understanding Viewstate")

If youâ€™re an ASP.Net Webforms developer this article should be mandatory reading â€“ itâ€™s that good!

Secondly thereâ€™s this awesome article about the new Code Contracts in dot.net 4.0. Whilst it isnâ€™t complete yet, thereâ€™s enough information for you to get started with Code Contracts. So whatâ€™re you waiting for ? Go read it here: [Code Contracts Part 1](http://devjourney.com/blog/code-contracts-part-1-introduction/ "Code Contracts Part 1")

Thatâ€™ll be all for now, hopefully Iâ€™ll be back soon with more exciting reading ðŸ™‚
