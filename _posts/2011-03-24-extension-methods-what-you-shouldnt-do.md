I‚Äôll admit it, I love extension methods, especially the ones from the [LinQ-to-objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx) framework.

However I often see them abused, partly by making everything extension methods, and partly by breaking readability with methods which normally shouldn‚Äôt work.

The latter requires an example, obviously:

```

public static bool IsNullOrEmpty(this string str)
{
	return string.IsNullOrEmpty(str);
}
```

What‚Äôs wrong with the above, you may wonder ? Well when using it it‚Äôll look like this:

```

string name = null;
if (!name.IsNullOrEmpty())
	Console.WriteLine(name);
```

Normally calling a method on a null object will throw a [NullReferenceException](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.nullreferenceexception.aspx), and rightly so!

Reading the above you‚Äôd think: this‚Äôll break. You‚Äôd have to dig into the IsNullOrEmpty extension method, in order to understand that it doesn‚Äôt break.

Now assume that the extension method resides in a 3rd party DLL, so you haven‚Äôt got the source code‚Ä¶ You‚Äôd have to test the method, or simply avoid it ‚Äì either way is bad.

Finally, how much did you actually gain by writing foo.IsNullOrEmpty() instead of string.IsNullOrEmpty(foo) ? Exactly 6 letters! (‚Äústring‚Äù).

Bottom-line: Don‚Äôt do this üôÇ

After this rant, I‚Äôll show you some extension methods I wrote and use frequently (most are for ASP.Net):

**ToHashSet**

```

public static HashSet<T> ToHashSet<T>(this IEnumerable<T> items)
{
	return new HashSet<T>(items);
}

public static HashSet<T> ToHashSet<T>(this IEnumerable<T> items, IEqualityComparer<T> comparer)
{
	return new HashSet<T>(items, comparer);
}
```

I for one don‚Äôt understand why this isn‚Äôt included in the [LinQ-to-objects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397919.aspx) framework, as it already has ToList, ToArray and ToDictionary.

It‚Äôs used the same way as the other ToFoo methods:

```

	var usernames = users
					.Select(user => user.Name)
					.ToHashSet();
```

**IsItem**

```

public static bool IsItem(this RepeaterItemEventArgs e)
{
	return (e.Item.ItemType == ListItemType.AlternatingItem || e.Item.ItemType == ListItemType.Item);
}

public static bool IsItem(this DataListItemEventArgs e)
{
	return (e.Item.ItemType == ListItemType.AlternatingItem || e.Item.ItemType == ListItemType.Item);
}
```

This one really shortens the check for ItemType inside ItemDataBound events of the respective repeating controls.

```

protected void repUsers_ItemDataBound(object sender, RepeaterItemEventArgs e)
{
	if (!e.IsItem())
		return;
	// As opposed to
	if (e.Item.ItemType != ListItemType.AlternatingItem && e.Item.ItemType != ListItemType.Item)
		return;
}
```

**FindControl**

```

public static T FindControl<T>(this RepeaterItemEventArgs e, string id) where T : Control
{
	return (T)e.Item.FindControl(id);
}

public static T FindControl<T>(this DataListItemEventArgs e, string id) where T : Control
{
	return (T)e.Item.FindControl(id);
}
```

A nice shortcut to the somewhat hideous syntax you‚Äôd otherwise use for setting e.g. Literals‚Äô Text inside ItemDataBound events:

```

protected void repUsers_ItemDataBound(object sender, RepeaterItemEventArgs e)
{
	var user = (User)e.Item.DataItem;
	e.FindControl<Literal>("litName").Text = user.Name;
	// As opposed to
	((Literal)e.Item.FindControl("litName")).Text = user.Name;
}
```

And that‚Äôs it, notice how few I have ‚Äì Either I‚Äôm missing out on something, or everything doesn‚Äôt have to be an extension method ‚Äì what do you think ?

Also if you‚Äôve got any nice extension methods up your sleeve, feel free to share them with me üôÇ (Dropping a comment)
