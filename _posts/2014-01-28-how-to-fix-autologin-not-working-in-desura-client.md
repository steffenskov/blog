Having recently reinstalled my main computer, I suddenly faced an annoying issue with the Desura client: It would not remember my login, even though I checked “Autologin” every single time.

The solution took a while to find, since many people has the issue, and few knows the answer – hence this blog post.

It’s really simple actually: Start the client, check “Autologin” and log in. Once the client is finished logging in, right click the tray icon and exit the client again.

From now on it should autologin in the future. It appears it only saves the “Autologin” setting when the client is being manually exited (very strange design choice, but oh well)

Hope it helps 🙂
