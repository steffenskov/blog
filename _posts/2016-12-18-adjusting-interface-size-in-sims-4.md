title: 'Adjusting interface size in Sims 4'

My wife recently started playing Sims 4 on our TV, however she found the interface to be slightly on the small size. Luckily changing this is extremely simple.

1. Open Documents
2. Then open Electronic Arts
3. Then open The Sims 4
4. Right-click on “options.ini” (it may just be called “options” on your PC) and select “edit”
5. Find the line that says “uiscale 100”
6. If you want to make the interface larger, you’ll have to reduce the number (100), and vice versa
7. For instance if you change the value to 50, everything will be exactly twice as large. If you changed it to 75, everything would be 50% larger. Likewise changing it to 200 would reduce the size to 50%, and changing it to 150 would reduce the size to 75%.
8. Save the file and start the game, if the size is still not to your liking you can always go back and alter the value some more

I hope this helps you guys and girls, and if not feel free to leave a comment 🙂
