This is a simple-to-use Bit.ly API wrapper for .Net. It makes use of the REST api for Bit.ly which is documented here: [code.google.com/p/bitly-api/wiki/ApiDocumentation](http://code.google.com/p/bitly-api/wiki/ApiDocumentation).

The wrapper is unfortunately not entirely feature complete, as Bit.ly has added more features since I developed this. It does however have all the core functions, which really is all youâ€™ll need.

It requires .Net 3.5 and includes full source code (of course).

Itâ€™s also my first project written using [TDD (Test Driven Development)](http://www.wikipedia.org/search-redirect.php?language=en&go=Go&search=Test_driven_development), so thereâ€™s a pretty large unit test suite included in the project.

The unit tests require Visual Studio 2010 Professional or higher, as Iâ€™m using VSâ€™ unit testing capabilities instead of [NUnit](http://www.wikipedia.org/search-redirect.php?language=en&go=Go&search=NUnit).

Finally hereâ€™s a simple example of using the library:

```

var client = new BitlyClient("yourlogin", "yourapikey");
var shortUrl = client.Shorten("http://www.ckode.dk/downloads/bit-ly-api-net-wrapper");
Console.WriteLine(shortUrl); // Writes "http://bit.ly/g8F9Lj"
```

And thatâ€™s all thereâ€™s too it ðŸ™‚
