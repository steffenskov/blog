I recently needed to re-encode a lot of my ripped CDs to a lower bit rate for my car stereo (it doesn‚Äôt cope well with 320 kbit apparently)

So I figured it‚Äôd be easy to do in a bash shell, and it was. I opted for using parallel to speed things up, by using all my CPU cores at once.

Start out by installing the necessary tools:

`sudo apt install lame parallel`

Then either create a bash script, or just copy-paste the script. I saved it as a bash script for easy re-runs in the future:

`#!/bin/bash<br></br>find . -name "*.mp3" | parallel lame --mp3input -m s -h -b 192 --cbr {0} {0}new<br></br>find . -name "*.mp3" -exec rm '{}' \;<br></br>find . -name "*.mp3new" -exec rename 's/mp3new/mp3/;' '{}' \;<br></br>`

It works by first finding all your mp3 files in the current working directory and feeding them through parallel to lame. I‚Äôve gone with a constant bit rate (cbr) of 192 kbit.  
Then I delete all the old files, and finally I rename all the ‚Äúmp3new‚Äù to simply ‚Äúmp3‚Äù ‚Äì voila job‚Äôs done.

Hope this little script is of use to you üôÇ
